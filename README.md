# TicTacToe
Worlds greatest time-wasting activity


Project By: Nick Cannone

The project runs a game of tic-tac-toe against my implementation of the minimax 
algorithm or against a heuristic-minimax with alpha beta pruning that runs approx 4x faster than the normal minimax.  Follow instructions
as prompted.  Enjoy:)
